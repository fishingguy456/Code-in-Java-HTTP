# Code-in-Java-HTTP
 
To run the HTTP Java server, first import the Java Project into an IDE like Eclipse or NetBeans. I used NetBeans to make this project. Next, change the parameter in line 26 to whatever port you would like to use. `ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(8080);` In this case, port 8080 was used. You can then run the code in the IDE and visit http://localhost:8080/ and change 8080 to whatever port you used.
